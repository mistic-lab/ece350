## Introduction

This lab is meant to be a supplement to your ELEC350 class. It will provide you with a way to explore the concepts and techniques discussed in class in a more hands on way. In order to do this, we will be using [GNU RadioCompanion](http://gnuradio.org/redmine/projects/gnuradio/wiki/GNURadioCompanion),a graphical tool used to create and execute signal processing flowgraphs for Software Defined Radio. This is a very useful tool, not only for demonstrating existing communication methods, but also for experimenting and developing new methods, both in the academic and professional worlds. For more information on Software Defined Radio, have a look at this[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software-defined_radio) page, or speak to your professor or TA.

The lab component of this course consists of several components:

- Lab 1. GNU Radio Tutorials.
- Lab 2. [USRP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Software_Radio_Peripheral) Tutorials and FM Receiver.
- Lab 3. Finding frame synchronization on the [FLEX](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLEX_(protocol)>) pager network using the USRP and GNU Radio.
- Lab 4. Pulse shaping and PSK
- Optional activity
  - Pass the amateur radio basic and advanced exams (contact Dr. Driessen)
  - Decoding off-air signals not covered in the other lab activities.
  - The deliverables are described at the beginning of each section.

**PLEASE NOTE:** You are encouraged to work at your own pace, using the
scheduled lab period as a time to get assistance from a TA or the
course instructor.
