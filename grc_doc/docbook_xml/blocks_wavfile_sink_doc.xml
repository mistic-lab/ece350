    <title>Wav File Sink</title>
  </sect2info>
  <para>Writes a float stream out to a Wav file. This file can be played back in GNU Radio with a Wav File Source or played in any other Wav file player. It can also be loaded into MATLAB using the "wavread" command.</para>

      <title>N Channels</title>
    </sect3info>
    <para><emphasis>Type: </emphasis>int</para>
    <para>Specifies the number of channels to read from the file. Wav files are typically mono (one channel, representing a single data stream) or stereo (two channels, representing either two independent data streams or the in-phase and quadrature components of a complex waveform).</para>

      <title>Sample Rate</title>
    </sect3info>
    <para><emphasis>Type: </emphasis>int</para>
    <para>Sets the sample rate that will be written in the Wav file header. For compatibility with other applications this should be one of the standard sample rates for Wav files such as 8000, 11025, 22050, 44100, 48000, etc. The sample rate of the input stream should match.</para>
